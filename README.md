# counter
This counter was created for a brewery where it is run on a Raspberry Pi and displays an estimation of Pints Poured (aka: pints of beer sold). The monitors used to display the counter are mounted upside-down, so the Raspberry Pi interface (not the counter.py app) has been adjusted to display upside-down. Additionally, the font used has been changed to Calibri from a font custom to the business. The code is modified from the guizero documentation located at: https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/blocking/
