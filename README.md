# counter

This is a simple counter for businesses to display how much product they have sold. Could be easily modified to count workplace accidents, etc. It is currently set up for a brewery where it is run on a Raspberry Pi and projects an estimation of Pints sold. The brewer can easily go into the program periodically to update the count to more accurately reflect brewery sales. Additionally, the output is printed to the screen upside-down because the monitors used to display the Pint count are mounted upside-down. That could easily be removed.
